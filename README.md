GettingAndCleaningData
======================

This repository contains a R script that performs a basic statistical analysis on the data set collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The data set is in the "UCI HAR Dataset".

Run the script in the root folder of the repository will generate the same result as in the "result.txt".

Also the code book explains the variables in the result.
